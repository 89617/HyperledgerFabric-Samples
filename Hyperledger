📘 What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, immutable way across a network of computers (nodes). Each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block—linking them together in a chain.

Key Features:

Decentralization: No central authority; all participants have a copy.

Immutability: Once data is written, it can't be altered.

Transparency: All transactions are visible to participants (depending on the blockchain type).

Consensus Mechanisms: Nodes agree on the state of the ledger using algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).

🔗 What is Hyperledger Fabric?
Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain framework hosted by The Linux Foundation as part of the Hyperledger project. Unlike public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, Fabric is designed for enterprise use cases where participants are known and trusted.

Key Features:

Permissioned Network: Only authorized members can join.

Modular Architecture: Pluggable consensus, identity management, etc.

Private Channels: Enables private transactions between specific members.

Smart Contracts (Chaincode): Business logic is written in Go, JavaScript (Node.js), or Java.

## 💻 Sample App Code (`application/app.js`)

```javascript
const { Gateway, Wallets } = require('fabric-network');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
    try {
        const ccpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'test-network', 'organizations', 'peerOrganizations', 'org1.example.com', 'connection-org1.json');
        const ccp = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(ccpPath, 'utf8'));

        const wallet = await Wallets.newFileSystemWallet('./wallet');

        const gateway = new Gateway();
        await gateway.connect(ccp, {
            wallet,
            identity: 'appUser',
            discovery: { enabled: true, asLocalhost: true }
        });

        const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
        const contract = network.getContract('basic');

        // Example: Create asset
        await contract.submitTransaction('CreateAsset', 'asset1', 'blue', '20', 'Tom', '100');
        console.log('✅ Asset created');

        // Example: Read asset
        const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('ReadAsset', 'asset1');
        console.log(`🔍 Asset: ${result.toString()}`);

        await gateway.disconnect();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`❌ Error: ${error}`);
        process.exit(1);
